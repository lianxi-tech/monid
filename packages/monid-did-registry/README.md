# MONiD DID Registry

This module encapsulates the logic required to anchor MONiD Identities using an instance of the MONiD [registry smart contract](https://github.com/lianxi-tech/monid/tree/master/packages/monid-registry-contract) and an IPFS gateway.
Additional functionality for updating the DID Document with a public profile is also exposed.
