# MONiD DID Method Specification

[LianXi-Tech](https://lianxi-tech.com), Dec/03/2020, V1

## Abstract

The MONiD DID method aims to implement Decentralized Identifier [did-core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) architecture in a secure, robust and flexible way. It's core technologies are bulit on Ethereum blockchain and the Interplanetary File System (IPFS).

## Overview

The MONiD DID method uses IPFS as verifiable data registry for DID Documents. The DID Document format is like:

```js
{
  '@context': 'https://w3id.org/did/v1',
  id: 'did:monid:85540cd700a8c3e37265072f2b35e3de4c3b35721e7fb02d146146262fdc8089',
  publicKey: [
    {
      id: `did:monid:85540cd700a8c3e37265072f2b35e3de4c3b35721e7fb02d146146262fdc8089#keys-1`,
      controller: 'did:monid:85540cd700a8c3e37265072f2b35e3de4c3b35721e7fb02d146146262fdc8089',
      publicKeyHex: '0298a5f231fc9224ca466bdbd0b27cb34d27939d0e8aa4b65ba4ef1ed805f14975',
      type: 'Secp256k1VerificationKey2018',
    },
  ],
  service: [
    {
      id: `did:monid:85540cd700a8c3e37265072f2b35e3de4c3b35721e7fb02d146146262fdc8089`,
      type: 'MONiDPublicProfile',
      serviceEndpoint: 'https://ipfs.monid.io/QmdBfKM9YQrtX5V4FvYhEVju8VsVE5488ufcJ9rWWgD892',
    },
  ],
}
```

On the Ethereum side, a [registry smart contract](https://github.com/lianxi-tech/monid/blob/master/packages/monid-registry-contract/contracts/Registry.sol) provides a mapping from a DID to an IPFS hash address of the corrosponding DID Document. Given a DID, MONiD did resolver module can the retrieve the DID Document from IPFS.

## Overall Architecture

![Architecture](./images/Architecture.png)

### @monid/did-driver

RESTful API server to wrap the main DID operations

### @monid/did-resolver

DID resolver module compatible with Decentralized Identifier [did-resolver](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/did-resolver) specification

### @monid/did-registry

DID registry module writing DID document into IPFS and calls the registry smart contract [setRecord](https://github.com/lianxi-tech/monid/blob/master/packages/monid-registry-contract/contracts/Registry.sol#L18) function to map the DID with the IPFS hash address

### @monid/registry-contract

Wrapper for deploying / interacting with an instance of the MONiD registry Ethereum smart contract

## Specification

### DID Method Format

MONiD DIDs are identifiable by `did:monid:` which are compatible with the W3C DID core [method scheme specification](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#method-schemes)

### Key Management

MONiD intergrates with [Torus Network](https://tor.us/), which is a decentralized key management service built on Ethereum blockchain, to provide a better user experience with high security and flexibility. A userâ€™s private keys are splited into shares across a Torus network of nodes, and Torus allows a user to retrieve this using natural login mechanisms like social authentication. Meanwhile, Tours nodes have managed volumes and snapshot policies to ensure that key shares will never get lost.

### DID Creation

There are 3 steps for MONiD to generate a new DID

- Retreives user public key from Torus Network
- Takes the keccak256 hash of the public key
- Generates MONiD DID in `did:monid:{{public key hash}}` format

### DID Registration

MONiD creates the mapping from DID to IPFS address hash on the smart contract using the [setRecord](https://github.com/lianxi-tech/monid/blob/master/packages/monid-registry-contract/contracts/Registry.sol#L18) function, making its DID Document accessable with only the corresponding DID

### DID Document Resolution

MONiD queries the registry smart contract's [getRecord](https://github.com/lianxi-tech/monid/blob/master/packages/monid-registry-contract/contracts/Registry.sol#L26) function with a DID to resolve the DID document. The IPFS address can then be resolved and MONiD sends the IPFS address to [MONiD IPFS Gateway](https://ipfs.monid.io/) to retrieve the corresponding DID Document

### DID Document Updating

MONiD updates the DID document by simply using the `setRecord` smart contract function with the same DID and a new IPFS hash of the updated DID Document

### DID Document Deletion

Deletion is archived by updating the registry to return an all-0 byte string
